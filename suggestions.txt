🪴 Grow calm from the soles of your feet.
🧘 Let your next exhale last one second longer.
🛋️ Sit like you’re listening to the quietest voice.
🌿 Let one thought bloom, then fade peacefully.
🧠 Say: “There’s wisdom in stopping.”
📘 Imagine closing a door to worry behind you.
🧊 Rest your awareness gently on your breath.
🛏️ Breathe as if cradling yourself in comfort.
🧘 Think: “Nothing else is needed now.”
🎵 Let your heartbeat be enough music for this moment.
🧠 Whisper: “Even small peace is still peace.”
